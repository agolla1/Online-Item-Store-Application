# Online-Item-Store-Application
This repository serves as the central hub for all microservices, collectively forming a large-scale application built on a microservices architecture.
# BookStore

BookStore is an online shopping platform designed for purchasing books. This application is built with the goal of exploring and learning various technologies through the development of a comprehensive, modular application that incorporates both frontend and backend components.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with multiple technologies by developing an application with realistic complexity. This project will be a valuable addition to my resume, demonstrating my skills as a Computer Science and Data Science major at UW-Madison with a minor in Entrepreneurship.

## Technical Architecture

The BookStore application is composed of several key components:

### 1. bookstore-webapp
This is the customer-facing web application where users can:
- Browse the available book catalog
- Add books to their shopping cart
- Proceed to checkout and place orders

### 2. bookstore-backoffice
This is an administrative application for staff members to manage the book catalog and orders. It enables administrators to:
- Set up and maintain the book catalog
- Manage customer orders and view their statuses

### 3. Backing Services
The backend services are designed as independently deployable microservices. These services can be developed using different programming languages or frameworks based on the teamâ€™s preference. They expose REST APIs for communication with the `bookstore-webapp`, `bookstore-backoffice`, and other services. Some services also act as event processors, consuming events from an event store (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), processing them, and optionally publishing new events.

### Frontend Implementation
The frontend web applications (`bookstore-webapp` and `bookstore-backoffice`) can be implemented using SPA frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, or React.js, or using server-side rendering technologies like Thymeleaf.

## Application Flow

The typical usage flow of the application is as follows:

1. **Customer Actions**:
   - Browse the product catalog
   - Add selected books to the cart
   - Proceed to the checkout page
   - Enter customer details, delivery address, and payment information
   - Place an order

2. **Order Processing**:
   - Validate order and payment details
   - If the payment is valid, set the status to `NEW`; otherwise, set it to `ERROR`
   - Save order details in the database
   - Publish an `OrderCreated` event if the payment is valid; otherwise, publish an `OrderError` event

3. **Event Handling**:
   - `OrderService` handles `OrderCreated` and `OrderError` events, sending appropriate email notifications to the customer
   - `DeliveryService` processes `OrderCreated` events, updates the status to `READY_TO_SHIP`, and later to `DELIVERED`, publishing an `OrderDelivered` event

## Backend Services

The application consists of several domain-oriented microservices:

### 1. Catalog Service
Manages the book catalog and provides the following REST API endpoints:
   - Get books by page
   - Get book details by ISBN
   - Create, update, and delete books
   - Search books by title or description

### 2. Payment Service
Validates payment information, such as credit card number, CVV, and expiry date.

### 3. Order Service
Handles customer carts and orders with the following API endpoints:
   - **Cart APIs**: Create, add items, update quantity, remove items, or delete a cart
   - **Order APIs**: 
     - Create and save orders; publish an `ORDER_CREATED` event
     - Cancel orders and publish an `ORDER_CANCELLED` event
     - Retrieve orders by number or list all orders
   - **Event Handlers**:
     - `ORDER_DELIVERED`: Update status to `DELIVERED`
     - `ORDER_CANCELLED`: Update status to `CANCELLED`
     - `ORDER_ERROR`: Update status to `ERROR`
   - **Email Notification Handlers**:
     - Send notifications for order creation, cancellation, delivery, or errors

### 4. Delivery Service
Manages order delivery and processes events:
   - `ORDER_CREATED`: Save order with status `READY_TO_SHIP`
   - **Jobs**:
     - `OrderDeliveryJob`: Processes orders with status `READY_TO_SHIP`, marks them as delivered, and publishes `ORDER_DELIVERED` events. In case of failures, it publishes `ORDER_ERROR` events.

## Contribution Guidelines

To contribute to the development of the BookStore application:
1. Run the application locally and report any issues.
2. Review the code and provide feedback.
3. Implement a service using your preferred language or framework.

## Conclusion

The BookStore project is a comprehensive, modular application aimed at providing a hands-on learning experience in full-stack development, microservices architecture, and event-driven systems. This project will serve as a showcase of my technical skills and understanding of modern web development practices.
